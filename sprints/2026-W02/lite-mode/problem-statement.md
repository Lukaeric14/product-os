# Problem Statement: Lite Mode

## One-Sentence Problem

**Product OS's 6-phase process is too heavy for small features, causing users to skip the tool entirely and implement chaotically — even though they still need structured thinking to achieve their goals.**

## Supporting Context

### Who experiences this?
- Solo product person + engineer (same person)
- Users with small, well-understood features
- Features that don't need multi-stakeholder coordination

### What's the impact?
- Product OS only used for complex features
- Small features implemented without structure
- Chaotic implementation, forgotten steps, unmet goals

### What does success look like?
- Product OS usable for ALL feature sizes
- Right-sized process depth for task complexity
- 4-command lite mode: `/start` → `/problem` → `/solution` → `/handoff`
- Faster time to implementation while maintaining structured thinking
