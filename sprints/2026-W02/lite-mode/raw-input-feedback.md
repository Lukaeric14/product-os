# Customer Feedback

**Source:** Self (Luka) — using Product OS for Nairon refactor

## Feedback

- The typical process took way too long
- Liked going through the checklist
- The STEPS felt redundant

## Interpretation

The value is in the structured thinking and outputs, not the number of phases. When steps feel redundant, the process is getting in the way rather than helping.
