# Session Transcript: Nairon Major Refactor

## What We Did

Ran the full Double Diamond process on Nairon Major Refactor:
- /start → /discover → /define → /develop → /deliver → /handoff
- Generated PRD for stripping down Nairon bot to simple bug tracking
- Committed to nairon-slackapp repo

## What Worked

- Step-by-step conversation kept things focused
- Iterating on wireframes through quick back-and-forth
- Skipping what wasn't needed (QA, tickets, loom)
- Ending with a Claude Code prompt for implementation

## What Was Friction

- Git commit confusion (nested repo issue)
- UI checkboxes didn't update for skipped items
- Had to say "skip" multiple times for deliverables
- Full process felt heavy when you're implementing it yourself

## Why Lite Mode

You're often both the product person AND the engineer. In this case:

- You don't need a Loom video to explain to yourself
- You don't need pre-written Linear tickets — you'll create them as you work
- You don't need a QA checklist — you'll build it
- You just need the PRD to capture decisions and hand off to Claude Code

The full 6-phase process is valuable for complex features with multiple stakeholders. But for smaller features or solo work, it's overhead.

**Note:** You = Me (Luka)
