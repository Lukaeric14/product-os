## Problem Context

After running the full Double Diamond process on Nairon Major Refactor, several friction points emerged that suggest the need for a lighter workflow option.

## Key Inputs

### From Session Transcript

**What worked:**
- Step-by-step conversation kept things focused
- Iterating on wireframes through quick back-and-forth
- Skipping what wasn't needed (QA, tickets, loom)
- Ending with a Claude Code prompt for implementation

**What was friction:**
- UI checkboxes didn't update for skipped items
- Had to say "skip" multiple times for deliverables
- Full process felt heavy when implementing yourself

**Core insight:**
> You're often both the product person AND the engineer. You don't need a Loom video to explain to yourself. You just need the PRD to capture decisions and hand off to Claude Code.

### From Feedback

- The typical process took way too long
- Liked going through the checklist
- The STEPS felt redundant

**Interpretation:** The value is in structured thinking and outputs, not the number of phases. When steps feel redundant, the process is getting in the way.

## Background

There's an existing PRD draft at `sprints/backlog/lite-mode-prd.md` that captures some initial thinking. User noted it "has a good idea of the problem" but "doesn't have exactly the solution I want."

## Design References

None provided.
