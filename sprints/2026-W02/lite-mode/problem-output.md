# Problem Output

## Core Desire

Product OS is designed for complex, multi-stakeholder features. But not every feature needs 6 phases — small bugs, quick improvements, or well-understood features don't benefit from extensive exploration.

Users want a tool that's usable for ALL feature sizes, not just complex ones.

## Reasoning Chain

The current 6-phase process creates friction for simple features:
- Users skip Product OS entirely for small features
- Without any process, implementation becomes chaotic
- The "all or nothing" approach limits adoption

A lighter process would capture the value of structured thinking without the overhead.

## Blind Spots

- Mode switching mid-feature could be useful but adds complexity
- Some "small" features reveal complexity during exploration
- Team members may disagree on what qualifies as "lite"

## Risks

- Over-simplifying could lead to missed requirements
- Users might default to lite mode even when comprehensive is needed
- Two codepaths increase maintenance burden

## Problem Statement

**Product OS's 6-phase process is too heavy for small features, causing users to skip the tool entirely and implement chaotically — even though they still need structured thinking to achieve their goals.**

### Supporting Context
- **Core need:** Right-sized process depth for task complexity
- **Key risks:** Users defaulting to lite when comprehensive is needed
- **Blind spots to watch:** "Simple" features that reveal complexity during exploration
